\title{Estimate the Difference Between Models}
\usage{
contrast_models(x, list_1 = NULL, list_2 = NULL,
  seed = sample.int(10000, 1))
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An object produced by \code{\link[=perf_mod]{perf_mod()}}.}

\item{list_1, list_2}{Character vectors of equal length that
specify the specific pairwise contrasts. The contrast is
parameterized as \code{list_1[i] - list_2[i]}. If the defaults
are left to \code{NULL}, all combinations are evaluated.}

\item{seed}{A single integer for sampling from the posterior.}
}
\value{
A data frame of the posterior distribution(s) of the
difference(s). The object has an extra class of
\code{"posterior_diff"}.
}
\description{
The posterior distributions created by \code{\link[=perf_mod]{perf_mod()}} can
be used to obtain the posterior distribution of the difference(s)
between models. One or more comparisons can be computed at
the same time.
}
\details{
If a transformation was used when \code{x} was created, the
inverse is applied \emph{before} the difference is computed.
